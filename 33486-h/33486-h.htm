There <I>is</I> no vacant chair.  The loving meet&mdash;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">A group unbroken&mdash;smitten, who knows how?</SPAN><BR>
One sitteth silent only, in his usual seat;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">We gave him once that freedom.  Why not now?</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Perhaps he is too weary, and needs rest;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">He needed it too often, nor could we</SPAN><BR>
Bestow.  God gave it, knowing how to do so best.<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Which of us would disturb him?  Let him be.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There is no vacant chair.  If he will take<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The mood to listen mutely, be it done.</SPAN><BR>
By his least mood we crossed, for which the heart must ache,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Plead not nor question!  Let him have this one.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Death is a mood of life.  It is no whim<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">By which life's Giver mocks a broken heart.</SPAN><BR>
Death is life's reticence.  Still audible to Him,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The hushed voice, happy, speaketh on, apart.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There is no vacant chair.  To love is still<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">To have.  Nearer to memory than to eye,</SPAN><BR>
And dearer yet to anguish than to comfort, will<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">We hold him by our love, that shall not die.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For while it doth not, thus he cannot.  Try!<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Who can put out the motion or the smile?</SPAN><BR>
The old ways of being noble all with him laid by?<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Because we love, he is.  Then trust awhile.</SPAN><BR>

Oh, joy of the dying!<BR>
At last thou art mine.<BR>
And leaping to meet thee,<BR>

Daring and doubting like pleasure<BR>
Forbidden, or Winter looking at May.<BR>

Oh, sorrow of living!<BR>
Make way for the thrill<BR>

Of the soul that is up and away!<BR>

Or only a sorrow left over from life,<BR>

How long was it since she died&mdash;who told?<BR>

She said: "I am come to Heaven at last,<BR>

But the custom of earth was stronger than Heaven,<BR>

THE UNSEEN COMRADES.[<A NAME="chap023fn1text"></A><A HREF="#chap023fn1">1</A>]<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Last night I saw an arm√®d band, whose feet<BR>
Did take the martial step, although they trod<BR>
Soundless as waves of light upon the air.<BR>
(Silent from silent lips the bugle fell.)<BR>
The wind was wild; but the great flag they bore,<BR>
Hung motionless, and glittered like a god<BR>
Above their awful faces while they marched.<BR>
And when I saw, I understood and said&mdash;<BR>
"If these are they whom we did love, and give,<BR>
What seek they?" But one sternly answered me,&mdash;<BR>
"We seek our comrades whom we left to thee:<BR>
The weak, who were thy strength; the poor, who had<BR>
Thy pride; the faint and few who gave to thee<BR>
One supreme hour from out the day of life,<BR>
One deed majestic to their century.<BR>
These were thy trust: how fare they at thy hands?<BR>
Thy saviors then&mdash;are they thy heroes now?<BR>
Our comrades still; we keep the step with them,<BR>
<I>Behold!  As thou unto the least of them<BR>
Shalt do, so dost thou unto us.  Amen.</I>"<BR>

GUINEVERE.<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Of Guinevere from Arthur separate,<BR>
And separate from Launcelot and the world,<BR>
And shielded in the convent with her sin,<BR>
As one draws fast a veil upon a face<BR>
That 's marred, but only holds the scar more close<BR>
Against the burning brain&mdash;I read to-day<BR>
This legend; and if other yet than I<BR>
Have read, or said, how know I? for the text<BR>
Was written in the story we have learned,<BR>
Between the ashen lines, invisible,<BR>
In hieroglyphs that blazed and leaped like light<BR>
Unto the eyes.  A thousand times we read;<BR>
A thousand turn the page and understand,<BR>
And think we know the record of a life,<BR>
When lo! if we will open once again<BR>
The awful volume, hid, mysterious,<BR>
Intent, there lies the unseen alphabet&mdash;<BR>
Re-reads the tale from breath to death, and spells<BR>
A living language that we never knew.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
This that I read was one short song of hers,<BR>
A fragment, I interpret, or a lost<BR>
Faint prelude to another&mdash;missing too.<BR>
She sang it (says the text) one summer night,<BR>
After the vespers, when the Abbess passed<BR>
And blessed her; when the nuns were gone, and when<BR>
She, kneeling in her drowsy cell, had said<BR>
Her prayers (poor soul!), her sorrowful prayers, in which<BR>
She had besought the Lord, for His dear sake,<BR>
And love and pity of His Only Son,<BR>
To wash her of her stain, and make her fit<BR>
On summer nights, behind the convent bars<BR>
And on stone-floors, with bruis√®d lips, to pray<BR>
Away all vision but repentance from her soul.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">When, kneeling as she was, her limbs</SPAN><BR>
Refused to bear her, and she fell afaint<BR>
From weariness and striving to become<BR>
A holy woman, all her splendid length<BR>
Upon the ground, and groveled there, aghast<BR>
That buried nature was not dead in her,<BR>
But lived, a rebel through her fair, fierce youth;<BR>
Aghast to find that clasped hands would clench;<BR>
Aghast to feel that praying lips refused<BR>
Like saints to murmur on, but shrank<BR>
And quivered dumb.  "Alas!  I cannot pray!"<BR>
Cried Guinevere.  "I cannot pray!  I will<BR>
Not lie!  God is an honest God, and I<BR>
Will be an honest sinner to his face.<BR>
Will it be wicked if I sing?  Oh! let<BR>
Me sing a little, of I know not what;<BR>
Let me just sing, I know not why.  For lips<BR>
Grow stiff with praying <I>all</I> the night.<BR>
Let me believe that I am happy, too.<BR>
A bless√®d bless√®d woman, who is fit<BR>
To sing because she did not sin; or else<BR>
That God forgot it for a little while<BR>
And does not mind me very much.<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 7em">Dear Lord,"</SPAN><BR>
(Said Guinevere), "wilt thou not listen while<BR>
I sing, as well as while I pray?  I shall<BR>
Feel safer so.  For I have naught to say<BR>
God should not hear.  The song comes as the prayer<BR>
Doth come.  Thou listenest.  I sing." ...<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Arise, and call her blessed,&mdash;seventy years!<BR>
Each one a tongue to speak for her, who needs<BR>
No poor device of ours to tell to-day<BR>
The story of her glory in our hearts.<BR>
Precede us all, ye quiet lips of love,<BR>
Ye honors high of home&mdash;nobilities<BR>
Of mother and of wife&mdash;the heraldry<BR>
Of happiness; dearer to her than were<BR>
The homage of the world.  We yield unto<BR>
The royal claims of tenderness.  Speak thou<BR>
Before all voices, ripened human life!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Arise, and call her blessed, dark-browed men!<BR>
She put the silver lyre aside for you.<BR>
She could not stroll across the idle strings<BR>
Of fancy, while you wept uncomforted,<BR>
But rang upon the fetters of a race<BR>
Enchained, the awful chord which pealed along,<BR>
And echoed in the cannon-shot that broke<BR>
The manacle, and bade the bound go free.<BR>
She brought a Nation on its knees for shame,<BR>
She brought a world into a black slave's heart.<BR>
Where are our lighter laurels?  O my friends!<BR>
Brothers and sisters of the busy pen,<BR>
Five million freemen crown her birthday feast,<BR>
Before whose feet our little leaf we lay.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Arise and call her blessed, fainting souls!<BR>
For whom she sang the strains of holy hope.<BR>
Within the gentle twilight of her days,<BR>
Like angels, bid her own hymns visit her.<BR>
Her life no ivy-tangled door, but wide<BR>
And welcome to His solemn feet, who need<BR>
Not knock for entrance, nor one ever ask<BR>
"Who cometh there?" so still and sure the step,<BR>
So well we know God doth "abide in her."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oh, wait to make her blessed, happy world!&mdash;<BR>
To which she looketh onward, ardently.<BR>
Lie in fair distance far, ye streets of gold,<BR>
Where up and down light-hearted spirits walk,<BR>
And wonder that they stayed so long away.<BR>
Be patient for her coming, for our sakes,<BR>
Who will love Heaven better, keeping her.<BR>
This only ask we:&mdash;When from prayer to praise<BR>
She moves, and when from peace to joy; be hers<BR>
To know she hath the life eternal, since<BR>
Her own heart's dearest wish did meet her there.<BR>

A TRIBUTE.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Blinded I groped&mdash;you gave me sight.<BR>
Perplexed I turned&mdash;you sent me light.<BR>
You speak unto a thousand ears:<BR>
I pay you tribute in hid tears.<BR>
I pay you homage in the hopes<BR>
That rise to scale life's scath√®d slopes.<BR>
I give you gratitude in this:<BR>
That, midway on the precipice<BR>
You never trod and never saw,<BR>
Where air you never drank, strikes raw<BR>
And wan upon the wasted breath,<BR>
And gulfs you never passed, gape death,<BR>
And crags you gained some sunlit way<BR>
Frown threatening over me to-day,&mdash;<BR>
That here with bruis√®d hand I cling,<BR>
Because I heard you yonder sing<BR>
With those who conquer.  If through joy,<BR>
Then deeper be our shame who toy<BR>
And loiter in the scourging rain,<BR>
And did not pass by strength of pain.<BR>
Laggard below, I reach to bless<BR>
You who are King of happiness;<BR>
You are the victor, you the brave,<BR>
Who could not stoop to be <I>her</I> slave.<BR>
Downward to me, rebuking, fling<BR>
My privilege of suffering.<BR>
I take and listen.  Teach me.  See!<BR>
Nearer than you, I ought to be;<BR>
Nearer the height man never trod,<BR>
Nearer the veiled face of God.<BR>
I ought, and am not.  Comrade! be<BR>
Unconscious captain unto me.<BR>
Unknowing, beckon and command:<BR>
I answer you with unseen hand.<BR>
You read in vain these lines between,<BR>
And smiling, wonder whom I mean.<BR>

And let me be to you, dear eyes,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The thing I am not, till I, too,</SPAN><BR>
Shall see as I am seen, and stand<BR>

And let me nobler than I am,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And braver still, eternally,</SPAN><BR>
And finer, truer, purer, than<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
To your sweet vision.  There I stand<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Transfigured fair in love's deceit,</SPAN><BR>
And while your soul looks up to mine,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">My heart lies at your feet.</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Believe me better than my best,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And stronger than my strength can hold,</SPAN><BR>
Until your magic faith transmute<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">My pebbles into gold.</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
I'll <I>be</I> the thing you hold me, Dear!&mdash;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">After I 'm dead, if not before&mdash;</SPAN><BR>
Nor, through the climbing ages, will<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">I give the conflict o'er.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But if upon the Perfect Peace,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And past the thing that was, and is,</SPAN><BR>
And past the lure of voices, in<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">A world of silences,</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
A pain can crawl&mdash;a little one&mdash;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">A cloud upon a sunlit land;</SPAN><BR>
I think in Heaven my heart must ache<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">That you should understand.</SPAN><BR>

A true knight!  Knowing neither worldly fear,<BR>

Tired with the little follies of the day,<BR>
A child crept, sobbing, to your arms to say<BR>
Her evening prayer; and if by God or you<BR>
Forgiven and loved, she never asked or knew.<BR>

With life's mistake and care too early old,<BR>
And spent with sorrow upon sorrow told,<BR>
She finds the father's heart the surest rest;<BR>
The earliest love shall be the last and best.<BR>

THE GATES BETWEEN.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Pearl-white, opaque and fixed fast,<BR>
Flashing between the hands unclasped,<BR>
Blinding between despairing eyes,<BR>
The awful Gates shut to, at last,<BR>
On comfort snatched, and anguish done,<BR>
On every moan beneath the sun,<BR>
Till we and ours, and joy are one.<BR>

This is your hour, Gates of God,<BR>
Your solemn hour, bars of gold,<BR>
But there shall come another yet.<BR>
Like silken sails you shall be furled,<BR>
Like melting mist you shall be set.<BR>

Oh, ye the dearest! vanished from<BR>
Love's little inner, sheltered spot.<BR>
To ye I whisper; not forgot,<BR>
But loved the dearer, nam√®d not.<BR>
Across the barrier old as life,<BR>
Lean to us from the Silent World.<BR>

Though days be blue, or gold,<BR>

And let me be Thy sea.<BR>
Thy storms have had their way.<BR>
I pray now not to pray.<BR>
